# DCGAN-painting-64x64

Tensorflow implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using custom data found in Kaggle. The training data cosist of 5000 impressionist landscape paintings in 1024x1024 RGB format. <br>
The goal of this project is to generate 'fake' paintings. The generated paintings should look somewhat like the real ones inputed, yet be diverse and not look EXACTLY like the inputed ones. <br>
In this project, the images are resized to 64x64 RGB format to make the learning process easier. There may be a future project targeting 128x128 sized images.
